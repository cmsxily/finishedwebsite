   <p> It is time to change how we think and speak about mental 
illness.</p>

 <h2> What is mental health? </h2
 <p>Mental health is something we all have. It includes your 
 thoughts, feelings about yourself and others, how we relate to 
 other people, how we function day to day and how we cope with the 
 ups and downs of life. Having good mental health it is not about 
 having no mental health problems, it's about feeling good enough 
 about ourselves. Being able to do the things that matter to us and 
 having the resilience to deal with the difficult situations we all 
 experience in life. </p> <p> Mental illness can come in many froms. 
 The American Psychiatric Association defines mental illness as a 
 health condition involving changes in thinking, emotion or 
 behavior. These conditions may affect someone's ability to relate to others and function each day. Mental illness may not be visible on 
 the outside, it doesn't mean somene isn't hurting on the inside.</p> <h5>Mental health can be complex because our experience of it is 
 personal and unique. What we know that the more we normalize 
 conversations about our mental health, the easier it will be for 
 young people and adults to seek the support they need when they 
 most need it.</h5> <p>When talking about mental health it can be 
 useful for us to think about it like a scale. A mental health scale 
 that goes from poor to good mental health, depending on what's 
 going on our lives, and the support we have around us. </p>

<h5> Mental health does not mean mental illness. </h5>     <h2> Why is mental health important? </h2>

 <div class="contenido2">
<p> We may not realise it but using these words to describe someone with a mental health condition can be very harmful.</p>
<p> Every 15 minutes someone dies from commiting suicide. That's 38,000 suicides each year. That's twice as many people that die by traffic fatality every year. 90% of suicides are related to mental health illneses. Global mental health is an area that's a little bit behind. The world health organization defines "health" as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being. Mental well-being is part of the definition of health. Why don't we talk about this?</p>
<p> Mental health is frecuently stigmitized around the world and some cultures don't even have words to describe mental health illneses. On top of that, it can be a difficult topic to discuss. </p>
  <p>Mental health and well-being go beyond neurological health. Depression is a risk factor for developing chronic diseases like hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.  </p>
  <h5> It is important for us to all work together, to incorporate mental health as part of our overall health profile.</h5>

<h2> Mental health wellness tips: </h2>
    <div class="contenido3"> 

   
 <p> <em>Focus on the positive</em>-think about the good things in your life, focus on solutions instead of the negatives (problems).</p>
<p> <em>Practice gratitude</em> -each day recognize the things you are grateful for.</p>
  <p><em>Connect with others</em>-being around friends and family can improve your mood and self-esteem. Meaningful relationships helps mantain a positive attitude which gives you space for personal growth.  </p>
  <p> <em> Mantain physical health</em>-have a healthy diet, exercise a litte each day, and get enough sleep. You will feel better after a workout even if it's just a walk around the block. </p>
  <p><em> Develop strong coping skills</em>-learn to respond in a healty way to stress, sadness, criticism, and negativity. One way of coping can be writing your negative experiences and how they made you feel.</p>
  <p> <em> Get professional help</em>-learn how to recognize the signs and symptoms that are a warning that you are not doing so well. It's better to reach out sooner rather than later. Asking for help takes courage, it does not mean you are weak. A health professional can help you in ways your friends and family can't.</p>
<p> It can be difficult to apply all of these onto your life, take your time and try them one by one. Some may help you, some may not because we are all different. </p>
